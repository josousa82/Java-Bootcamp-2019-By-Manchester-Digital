Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but...

Numbers that are exact multiples of 3, or that contain the number 3, 
must print a string containing "Fizz"

   For example 9 -> "Fizz"
   For example 31 -> "Fizz"

Numbers that are exact multiples of 5, or that contain the number 5, 
must print a string containing "Buzz"

   For example 10 -> "Buzz"
   For example 51 -> "Buzz"

Any other number is just printed.

Your program should handle edge cases and respond to the user in an 
appropriate manner.
