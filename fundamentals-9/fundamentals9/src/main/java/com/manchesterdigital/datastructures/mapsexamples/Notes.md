## Map Interface
    
    * Has to be extended / can not be instantiated, use "new"
        Example:
        Not a good practice, not interchangeable
        
        ```
         
                Map<String, String> countries = new HashMap<String, String>();
                countries.put("enGB","England");
                countries.put("esEs","Spain");
                countries.put("ptPt","Portugal");


        ```
