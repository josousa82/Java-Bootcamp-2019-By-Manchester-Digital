# Fundamentals 2

## Coding Standards

###  - File organization 

	 - Styling sintax, 
		
		. Commum sintax formating (Oracle, Google, company standars)
	
	 - Comments in Java
	 
		. // comment a single line
		
		. /* Block comment */
		
		. Documentation comment style, comment that will be gathered to the java doc (documentation) creation 
		  from IDE Intelijj
			
			.  /**
				* @author Jose Sousa // @ will format in a different way
				*/
		
	 - Line length
		
		. 80 chars
 
     - Method declaration is known has a method signature
	 
## Intelijj Shortcuts
		
	- psvm  snippet main method
	- sout  System.out.println() snippet
	
## Variables in Java

	- We started with int variables,  and a small reference to the difference between primitive variables
	- Naming conventions for variables, camel case  as a good practice

	
	. long types may be used for example in database indexes
	
	. float pi = 3.14f; // how to define a float, the "f" in the end makes it explicit, can´t be casted
                            // float vs double use case have to do with precision points
    . double pi2 = 3.14d; // how to define a double, the "d" in the end makes it explicit, can´t be casted
